# Marketing-Campaign-for-an-Airplane-company

Problem Statment: The marketing team did not have good insights about their customers and were wanting good groups of customers so that
each of them can be targeted in a customized manner

Followed CRISP methodology for data mining process. It had 6 stages in it:

1) Business Understanding
The client did not want customers with different flying patterns to be in the same group.
Each group of customers could be assigned to a different manager and different strategies can be applied. The partitioning of the customers 
were not done by humans because it ws very tough, time cousnuming and not cost effective. this would enable enhancedd customer relationship
management too.

2) Data Understanding

The client wanted non - hierarchial groups. All the customers data were treated at the same level. The clients also wanted the customers 
to be in mutually exclusive groups
HAd around 25 variables of the customers like - Customers frequency of travel in ayear, preferered set of flights, preferened set of seat
allocation, preferred number of bags they carry, type of check in method they use, type of security checks they use, number of states within 
the country they travel to, number of countries they travel to outside their own country, do they like insurance or not? etc

3) Data preparation
