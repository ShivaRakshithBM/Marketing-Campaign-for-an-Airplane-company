# Marketing-Campaign-for-an-Airplane-company

Problem Statment: The marketing team did not have good insights about their customers and were wanting good groups of customers so that
each of them can be targeted in a customized manner

Followed CRISP methodology for data mining process. It had 6 stages in it:

1) Business Understanding
The client did not want customers with different flying patterns to be in the same group.
Each group of customers could be assigned to a different manager and different strategies can be applied. The partitioning of the customers 
were not done by humans because it ws very tough, time cousnuming and not cost effective. this would enable enhancedd customer relationship
management too.

2) Data Understanding

The client wanted non - hierarchial groups. All the customers data were treated at the same level. The clients also wanted the customers 
to be in mutually exclusive groups
HAd around 25 variables of the customers like - Customers frequency of travel in ayear, preferered set of flights, preferened set of seat
allocation, preferred number of bags they carry, type of check in method they use, type of security checks they use, number of states within 
the country they travel to, number of countries they travel to outside their own country, do they like insurance or not? etc

3) Data preparation

4) Modelling:

Used Kmeans and K mediods clustering to start off as these are non hierarchial clustering algorithms. Later tried out DBSCAN algorithm, 
followed by hierarchial clustering to evaluate other options

K means: Input are k: number of clusters
D: a data set containing n objects

Output: A set of k clusters
Algorithm / Method followed:

Arbitrarily choose k objects from D as tge initial cluster centers
Repeat:
  re(assign) each object to the cluster to which the object is the most similar based on the distance between the mean and object
  update the cluster means, that is to calculate the men value of the objects for each cluster
Until No change;

K Mediods:
Input: K = Number of clusters
D: DAta set containing the n objects (5000 customers)
 
Output: K clusters

algorithm / Method

Build phase:
1) Select k objects to become the mediods
2) Calculate the dissimilarity matrix 
3) Assign every object to the closest mediod

Swap phase:
4) For each cluster seacr if any object of the cluster decreases the average dissimilarity coefficient; if it does, select
the object that decreases this coiefficient the most as the mediod for this cluseter
5) If at lease one mediod has changed go to 3) or else end algorithm

MAtrix of dissimilarity is computed using 2 metrics:
1) The euclidean distances, that are the root sum of square distances
Manhattan distancesthe sum of absolute differences

Evaluation:
The major tasks of clustering evaluation included the following:
1) Assessing clustering tendancy: Calculated the Hopkins statistic and it was < 0.5, indicating statistically significant clusters
2) To determine the number of clusters: Simplest way used is sqaure.root(n/2) where n is the number of data points
Also, used the elbow curve method which is based on the observation that increasing the number of clusters can help to reduce the sum
of intra cluster variance of the clusters
3) Also used cross validation to get the best number of clusters
4) Silhoutte coefficient is calculated
